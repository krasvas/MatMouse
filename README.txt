MatMouse toolbox is a MATLAB tool suitable for the performance of experimental studies based on mouse movements tracking and analysis. The toolbox supports the implementation of task-based visual search experiments. MatMouse provides specific functions which can be utilized for the experimental building and mouse tracking processes, the analysis of the recorded data in specific metrics, the production of related visualizations, as well as for the generation of statistical grayscale heatmaps which could serve as an objective ground truth product. MatMouse could be executed as standalone package, integrated to existing MATLAB scripts and/or toolboxes.

A list of demo source code and data is also available with MatMouse toolbox in order to help you to prepare your experimental process and analysis. Please, place your source code at the same folder with MatMouse's core functions.
